N-gram
      </summary>
      <p>
To work without any word delimiters is a remarkable advantage of the N-gram method.  
Because Japanese language does not put delimiters between words, 
it is hard to extract "words" by machine as a minimum unit of index key.  
      </p>
      <p>
This library is optimized to the Bigram (size 2), though the size can be changed.  
By default, indexes of size 2 and 1 are generated, 
so a text "cat" will be indexed by "ca", "at", "c", "a" and "t".  
      </p>
      <p>
This library uses json files to store indexes.  
Everything is text and easy to handle by any script languages, including JavaScript.  
      </p>

      <summary>
Index file name
      </summary>
      <p>
To perfome fast reading, the library uses the hierarchy file system to place indexes.  
Each index is encoded as an ascii string of unicode numbers.  
For example, a key "ca" will be "00630061".  
Here, "c" is <code>U+0063</code> and "a" is <code>U+0061</code>.  
This makes all unicode characters, even the control characters, safe to be indexed.  
      </p>
      <p>
Though files can also be placed in a single directory flatly, 
they are placed in a tree of directories by default.  
Too many files in a single directory will slow down the system.  
The above index file will be "./00/63/00/61.json".  
      </p>
    </details>

      <summary>
Index file format
      </summary>
      <p>
Array of array as json.  
The inner array has two elements, namely, an identification and a position.  
The identification is a unique id for a single file, and it may be a file path.  
The position is a location of the key string within a file.  
All pairs that found to have the key string is listed as the outer array.  
      </p>
      <pre>
[
  ["a/b.txt", 129],
  ["c/d/e.txt", 148]
]
      </pre>
      <p>
For example, when the json file for the key "ca" is as above, it means:  
In "a/b.txt" at position 129, "ca" is found.  
In "c/d/e.txt" at position 148, "ca" is found.  
And the position means the occurrence position from the beginning of text 
with 0 for the first character .
