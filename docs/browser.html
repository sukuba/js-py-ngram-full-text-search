    <h3>Recommended</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>
FireFox and Safari are recommended browsers. 
      </summary>
      <p>
Both are good both in http and file protocols.

Another browsers (How do you know your browser works with this library? )

        <summary>
With Web Standards
        </summary>
        <p>
Modern browsers come with Web Standards such as W3C are required. 
Important keywords may be html5, css3 and ecma6. 
Some browsers could be slow on JavaScript ajax callings 
because they do not asign enough resources for scripting.  
But don't worry, this requirement is not so high. 
A built-in browser (not FireFox) on my Android phone 
can work with satisfying speed. 
Check the <a href="demo/index.html" target="_blank">online demo</a> page 
to see your browser's capability now. 
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>
Allow local file accesses
        </summary>
        <p>
Security policy of cross domain must allow dynamic reading for local files under subdirectories. 
Google Chrome and Microsoft IE do not meet this requirement.  
The iPhone and iPad are also unsupported platforms for the local usage, 
because iOS has strong restriction on local file accesses. 
Alternately, <code>http://</code> protocol can be used for these browsers 
that have difficulties in <code>file://</code> protocol, 
if you have a static http server.

    <h3>Unsupported</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>
Microsoft IE (Internet Explorer) cannot be used. 
      </summary>
      <p>
Because it is not on Web Standards.
